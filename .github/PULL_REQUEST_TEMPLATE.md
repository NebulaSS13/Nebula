<!-- If you're opening a pull request which changes A LOT of icon/map files: -->
<!-- Add [IDB IGNORE] (to ignore icon file changes) or [MDB IGNORE] (to ignore map file changes) in the PR title. -->
<!-- These tags prevent huge diffs from overloading IconDiffBot and MapDiffBot. -->

## Description of changes
<!-- Describe the pull request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->

## Why and what will this PR improve
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding. -->

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->
