Examples were changelog entries are optional/not typically required:
* Cosmetic changes such as descriptions, sound effects, etc.
* Optimizations and other changes to underlying systems which do not affect gameplay.

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->
