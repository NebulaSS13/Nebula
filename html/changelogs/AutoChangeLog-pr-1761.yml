changes:
  - rscadd: Ports the aspect system from Europa, specifically the backend, not the
      aspects themselves. This is a menu in character preferences that allows you
      to pick a series of traits for your character, as in some RPGs.
  - tweak: Moves prosthetic limbs, prosthetic organs, amputated limbs and nearsightedness
      onto aspects instead of the Physical tab.
  - tweak: Moves preview options from the Physical tab to the header of character
      preferences.
