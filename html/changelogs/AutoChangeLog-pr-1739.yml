changes:
  - tweak: There is now a user feedback message for wiring a window.
  - rscadd: You can now de-polarize a window by using wirecutters to remove the wiring.
  - tweak: The set id prompt when using multitools on polarized windows now defaults
      to the current id instead of null.
  - rscadd: Using a multitool on an anchored (fully installed) window now toggles
      the tint instead of changing the ID. To change the ID, unanchor the window first.
  - tweak: Examining windows now tells you if they are anchored and/or polarized,
      and the construction state (screwdriver/crowbar steps) of reinforced windows.
