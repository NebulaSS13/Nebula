changes:
  - rscadd: Added two new layers to walls, paint and striping. Walls will now maintain
      their material coloring, and instead have paint colors applied as paint layers
      on top. Standard walls can be painted two-tone with the main body and striping
      (wooden walls too).
  - rscadd: Wall paintability is now defined by their materials.
  - rscdel: Removed legacy wall stripe system in favor of the new paint striping.
  - tweak: Wall edge connections to things like windows and airlocks have been simplified,
      fixing a few erroneous connections.
  - tweak: The paint sprayer has finer control when interacting with walls and wall
      frames.
  - tweak: Renamed airlock paint flags to be generic. These are now also used for
      defining wall paintability.
