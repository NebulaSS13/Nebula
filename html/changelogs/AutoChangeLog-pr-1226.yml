changes:
  - tweak: Amputating the second-to-last organ on a human mob (typically leaving the
      torso) will drop the last organ as a limb and destroy the mob -in other words
      you can now chop bodies up entirely instead of being left with a weird unwieldly
      torso.
  - tweak: Amputation is faster but messier if you're doing it improperly (improvised
      tool or circumstances).
  - tweak: Failing an amputation will now get the tool stuck in the person's limb.
