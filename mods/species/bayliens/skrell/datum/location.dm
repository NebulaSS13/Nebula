	belong to no particular Qrii'Qerria and instead are governed by the SDTF of the system in which they reside, with all \
	services and installations under the control of the local Raskinta SDTF Commander rather than a Qrii-Skria. Life in \
	these circumstances is often more regimented and disciplined, with a stronger emphasis on community and collaboration, \
	with varying extremes depending on the status, funding and level of military engagements the SDTF is currently in."
