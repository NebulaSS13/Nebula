	description = "The Skrellian High Kingdoms comprise a network of collectivist constitutional monarchies that strive for \
	self-sufficiency. Though they are not isolationist, they generally tend to their own except when they need to share \
	resources. Personal liberties aren't held as highly as in human territories, and most individuals are quite content to fit \
	neatly into the rigidly-defined Caste system that the skrell have used for millenia. Kiquol outsiders struggle to fit in to \
	Caste, but the Skrell have made efforts to accomodate human and positronic immigrants."

	description = "Ue-Katish ships have no caste system even for the truecaste Skrell and aliens who live there, although still \
	regimented by rank and role in the ship's functioning. Ue-Katish ships are floating black markets where everything is available \
	for the right price, including some of the galaxy's most well-connected information brokers and most skilled guns-for-hire. \
	The Ue-Katish present the greatest skrellian counterculture and feature heavily in romanticized human media, although at their \
	hearts they are in fact bandits and criminals, and the black markets are filled with goods plundered from human and \
	skrellian trade ships."

	name = "Qerr-Gila"
	description = "The Qerr-Glia have their roots in Qerr-Katish royals deposed in the last of the great wars on the Skrellian homeworld. \
	Rather than accept disgrace as Ue-Katish, they turned to a life of crime. While the Qerr-Glia have at their disposition a very large \
	network of relations and maintain several fragile alliances between various families, their only loyalty resides in their own family. \
	They will temporarily hire anyone competent enough to fulfill their goals, willfully or forcefully, but only the members of the \
	Qerr-Glia family are permanent members of a Qerr-Glia cell. Any Skrell abandoning their Qerr-Gila siblings for any reason would find \
	themselves fiercely hunted down by their former brothers and sisters. "
