	description = "The rulers of Skrellian society. Managers, diplomats, lawyers, \
	they are notably the only caste allowed to fulfill the role of Qerr-Skria. \
	The Qerr-Katish pride themselves on sociability, sophistication, self-improvement, and organization. \
	The Qerr-Katish are, unsurprisingly, the staunchest supporters of \
	the caste system and tend towards social conservatism. \
	Qerr-Katish families tend to be rather small, with many Qerr bonding only once or even not at all. \
	Owing to their small numbers and high standing, the Qerr-Katish are the richest caste \
	and their investments control the expansion of Skrellian territory, industry, and culture. \
	They often dress in clothing made from soft, shiny materials, \
	sometimes compared to the clothing of ancient Chinese nobles by human scholars. \
	Their skin is generally bright green. \
	Qerr-Katish headtails are famously long, reaching down nearly to their waists."

	description = "Educators, writers, and scientists of all sorts, the Malish-Katish are the ones \
	who allow Skrellian society to continue to improve itself, both materially and socially. \
	The Malish-Katish's tradition of rational skepticism tends to make them less conservative than most Skrell. \
	However, they have a cultural disdain towards social niceties and tendencies towards anxiety \
	that make them infrequent questioners of the status quo. \
	As the caste most often involved in working with other races, they tend to be seen as the archetypical Skrell. \
	The average Malish-Katish mates two or three times. \
	They are less wealthy than the Qerr, but not by much. \
	They wear more practical garments of the same rich materials as used by the Qerr-Katish. \
	Their skin is generally pale green, sky blue or pale yellow. \
	They have average-length headtails."

	description = "The manual workers and craftsmen of the Skrell. \
	'Builder' is a bit of a nicety -- the Kanin-Katish are the caste of the laborer. \
	They are fond of simple pleasures and tend not to pay much heed to politics, \
	which are usually beyond their ability to influence. \
	They usually mate four or more times, putting a strain on their already tight finances. \
	Family solidarity is more important to the Kanin than to most Skrell, \
	and success as a Kanin is usually measured by one's number of main-line descendants \
	(and their opinion towards their patriarch or matriarch). \
	They wear simple cloth clothing, often importing synthetic cotton from SolGov to save on costs. \
	Their skin is generally red, orange, pale yellow, dark orange or black. \
	They have average-length headtails."

/decl/background_detail/heritage/skrell/caste_talum
	name = "Skrell - Talum-Katish"
	description = "The Talum are artists, artisans, aesthetes, and sometimes propagandists. \
	The breadth of experience and freedom of thought required for truly great works of art \
	lends them to a greater degree of individuality than most Skrell have, \
	tempered by their need for a robust social life and their close working relationship with the Qerr-Katish. \
	Talum artistry is less free-form than human artistry and tends to incorporate \
	psychological principles in an attempt to increase its resonance with the target audience. \
	The Talum are frequently unable to compete with humanity and tend to stay within Skrell space, \
	but their works escape over the border at a massive rate. \
	They tend to have around three matings in their lifetime, \
	but the Talum infant mortality rate is noticeably higher than that of the other castes. \
	Talum wear whatever clothing suits them, \
	but a Talum without some sort of headtail accessory is seen as embarrassingly underdressed. \
	Their skin is generally purple, blue, pink, orange, red or white. \
	Talum-Katish headtails are a middle ground between the medium headtails of the Malish and Kanin and the extremely long headtails \
	of the Qerr, and are an important element of Talum self-expression."

	description = "The Raskinta are the strongest, quickest, and most decisive Skrell. \
	Rarely seen outside Skrell space, the Raskinta-Katish almost universally serve \
	in the military of a city state, with manual labor seen as a dire insult. \
	They are the most conservative branch of the Skrell, owing to their suspicious and xenophobic culture. \
	The Raskinta take the usual scientific approach to their branch of labor, \
	being experts in irregular warfare, group tactics, and the use of various exotic weapons. \
	They tend to have about two matings per Skrell, but are also the shortest lived -- even if they survive combat, \
	their large, muscle-rich bodies put an unusual amount of strain on the weak Skrellian heart. \
	They wear the same simple, practical clothing as the Talum-Katish, \
	which also helps them remain unnoticed in a crowd. \
	Their skin is generally green, blue, black, brown or yellow. \
	Raskinta headtails are extremely short. Uniquely among Raskinta, \
	loss of a headtail is not seen as disfiguring, especially if it was lost in battle."

	the Ue-Katish have no place in the regimented society of the Skrell. \
	Many work in various forms of dangerous, unpleasant, and low-paying labor, \
	and discrimination is extremely common. \
	Many Ue-Katish are born sterile or sterilized shortly after hatching, \
	and other genetic abnormalities abound. \
	This discrimination leads many Ue-Katish to try passing themselves off as another caste \
	(usually one of their parents'), \
	to leave to more tolerant human space, or even to take up a life of crime."
