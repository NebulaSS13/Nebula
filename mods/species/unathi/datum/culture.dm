	The actions of one unathi should benefit the species as a whole, referred to as The Unity. Those who fall out of this line of \

	description = "Those clans who have collectively broken away from the dogma of the Unity, for whatever reason. This isn't a specific \
	label so much as a catchall term for any clan with differing beliefs from the mainline Unathi. So-called Heretic Clans have, in the past, \
	occasionally gained enough influence to change the Unity. That fact, coupled with the Unity's compunction against killing other Unathi, \
	has caused most Heretic Clans to be seen less as heretics, and more as lifestyle activists."

	Some Unathi are stripped of their clan title as punishment for heinous crimes. All of these individuals are considered part of a group known as \
	the Unbound. Unbound Unathi are rarely welcomed by Unathi who still part of the Clan system. The process of becoming an Unbound Unathi is \
	incredibly traumatic; one's clan is a fundamental aspect of one's identity, and use of one's former clan name with no more claim to it is a grave \
	dishonor. Their entrance into the afterlife is jeopardized, as without the important resources and training provided within the clan structure, \
	Unbound must push themselves harder to earn their place in death. Some Unbound Unathi rename themselves, or go by self-given grandiose titles."

	as the organization draws almost exclusively from those Unbound who wish to find a purpose again, and the children of the Redeemed. Unbound are \
	taken in by a Redeemed, and have their remaining names removed, to begin the process of killing the old to allow room for the new. The new Initiates \
	then spend their days living in asceticism, being reintroduced to their old crafts and the Unity by those Redeemed who have walked similar paths."

	description = "The yeosa'unathi are a minority population of unathi that originated in the swampland and waterways close to the polar regions of Moghes.\
	Yeosa culture tends to be quite laid-back, folding the necessity of not destroying their limited arable homeland into a general attitude of taking it easy \
	and avoiding greed or profit to the detriment of the land. The prevalence of psychoactive mushrooms and wildlife in the regions they tend to live has also \
	been worked into their cultural practices to varying degrees, with recreational and religious hallucinogenics being common. "
