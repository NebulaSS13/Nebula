	settlements within the space once claimed by the Imperial Aegis. When the Aegis collapsed, several hundred years ago, the \
	resulting wars and squabbling took decades to settle, and in many places the tensions and conflicts still run hot. Most of \
	the Splinter Kingdoms emulate the peasant-noble social heirarchies of the Aegis, but a variety of other forms of governance \

	the people of the steppe are hardy, independant, and primarily occupied with survival in the resource-poor and harsh conditions \
	of their home. Most groups are nomadic, following their flocks of aurochs or other livestock between water sources and grazing land."
