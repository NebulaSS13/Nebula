	name = "Wanderer"
	description = "You are transient and unbeholden to any particular political or ideological group."

/decl/cultural_info/faction/fantasy/barbarian
	name = "Steppe Warrior"
	description = "When the first migrants from the Nine Mothers left the steppe for the downlands, they traded a warrior spirit and \
	a connection to their ancestors for comfort and riches. You and your compatriots know better. The fat, soft downlanders, safe behind \
	their walls and fed by their gardens, are little better than placid livestock. They should be shown the true way of the world by force."

/decl/cultural_info/faction/fantasy/centrist
	name = "Kingdom Citizen"
	description = "Firebrand rhetoric and rabble-rousing don't hold a candle to a roof over your head, well-maintained roads, \
	and a full belly. You might not like the nobles or merchants who run your settlement, but they're probably better than the alternative."

/decl/cultural_info/faction/fantasy/aegis
	name = "Imperial Revivalist"
	description = "The Aegis may have collapsed over a hundred years ago, but the loss is still keenly felt. You and your fellows \
	believe that returning the true blood of the Old Queens to the Imperial Throne will resolve the confusion and chaos of the modern \
	day, and usher in a second golden age beneath their benevolent leadership."

/decl/cultural_info/faction/fantasy/primitivist
	name = "Anima Primitivist"
	description = "Before the Imperial Aegis, before towns and cities, the natural world lived and breathed, fought and died and rotted \
	and was reborn. Civilization has built walls between the people and their true selves, and only by returning to a state of nature, \
	dismantling the cities and allowing primal anima to flow freely again, can we be truly alive."
