	description = "Humans are a kind of tall, furless ape common to the downlands and the warmer parts of the Nine Mothers, \
	as well as more remote locales. Although they lack the natural ferocity of hnoll, and are larger and clumsier than kobaloi, \
	they are often stubborn and tenacious, as well as quick-witted and clever with their hands. In the downlands, humans are more \
	numerous than either kobaloi or hnoll, but were considered second-class citizens under the hnoll-ruled Imperial Aegis that \
	'civilized' them in the distant past; an attitude that survives to this day in some isolated pockets of the Splinter Kingdoms."
