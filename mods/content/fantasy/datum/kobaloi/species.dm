	caves, eating mushrooms and moss, but in the modern era an increasing number of kobaloi families have left their traditional \
	warrens to take up residence in cities and settlements on the surface. The collapse of the Imperial Aegis went largely unnoticed \
	by the kobaloi, and they usually try to keep out of any hnoll-human political or ideological conflicts if they can."
