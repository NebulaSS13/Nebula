		<h2>The Basics</h2>
		<p>Slimes are strange creatures reared for their valuable extracts. They feed by engulfing their prey and degrading them at the cellular level, eventually dissolving them entirely. A hungry slime can  be fended off with water, usually from a fire extinguisher; don't bother trying to use weapons or firearms on a being made of semiliquid goo. You can wrestle a slime off its prey, including yourself, by clicking on it with disarm, harm or grab intent.</p>
		<h2>Slime Breeding</h2>
		<p>When a baby slime is well-fed enough, it will mature into an adult; adults are much larger, <i>much</i> more dangerous, and capable of reproducing by splitting into four smaller slimes. Each of the children has a chance of mutating into a different colour, with different effects associated with their extracts. See the table at the bottom of this guide for a list of parent and child colours.</p>
		<h2>Extracts and Reactions</h2>
		<p>If you cull a baby slime, either by water or starvation, you can then drag it over to the operating table and use a scalpel and saw to remove the slime cores inside. These cores can be injected with ground-up uranium (use the reagent grinder in your lab), or blood (either your own or from a donor), to evoke strange and powerful effects. Consult the bottom of this guide for details on extract reactions.</p>
		<h2>Friendship</h2>
		<p>Slimes are intelligent, social creatures, even if they don't look like it. Physical affection (click a slime on help intent) will start an enduring friendship that will last until you attack the slime, or it gets hungry enough to see you as food. Saying hello to a friendly slime will also make them regard you more fondly. Slimes that regard you well enough may even listen to commands like 'stop', 'stay' or 'follow'.</p>
