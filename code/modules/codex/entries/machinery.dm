Pulsing the correct wire will toggle the bolts, but cutting it will only drop them.<BR>* IDscan light indicates the door can scan ID cards. If the wire for this is pulsed it will cause the door to flash red, and cutting it will cause doors with restricted access to be unable to scan ID, essentially locking it.<BR>* The AI control light shows whether or not AI and robots can control the door. Pulsing is only temporary, while cutting is more permanent.<BR>* The test light shows whether the door has power or not. When turned off, the door can be opened with a crowbar.<BR>* If the door sparks, it is electrified.
