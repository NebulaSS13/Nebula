You then use the multitool to pulse the wires, and in response some of the displayed information may change, causing certain effects to occur or allowing for certain benifits. If you don't have a multitool, you can cut the wires. Pulsing tends to cause temporary changes or toggles something, whereas cutting a wire is usually longer lasting, but this is not always the case.
