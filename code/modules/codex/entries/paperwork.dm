	mechanics_text = "Textbooks provide <span codexlink='Skills (category)'>skill</span> buffs, raising the relevant skill by one level. In order to use textbook, you must have the matching skill that the textbook teaches, at the level it can buff. To use a textbook, simply hold it in your active hand and click it. You must then wait for a short period of time, after which you will have the skill buff indefinitely. However, the skill buff will be removed the moment the textbook is closed (used again) or removed from your hand in any way (dropped, put in a container, destroyed, etc). This process can be repeated without consequence, though only one textbook can be used at any one time. <BR><BR> \
	<h4>Custom Skill Books</h4> \
	Those with Master level <span codexlink='Literacy (skill)'>Literacy</span> can create a textbook with the use of an autobinder and a suitable writing implement. This works much the same way as writing a normal book(use pen on book) but rather than manually writing the contents, the Skill option is selected from the menu. To imbue the book with any given skill, the writer must possess the relevant skill at the level they desire. After successfully selecting the skill and level, the writer must then repeatedly use the pen on the book until it is complete. Only once complete can it be used as a skill book. <b>Important note</b>: You may only write two skill books during a round. If a textbook you wrote gets destroyed, it does not enable you to write another to replace it."
