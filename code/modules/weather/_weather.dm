/*
 * Notes on weather:
 *
 * - Weather is a single object that sits in the vis_contents of all outside turfs on
 *   its associated z-levels and is removed or added by /turf/proc/update_weather(),
 *   which is usually called from /turf/proc/set_outside().
 *
 * - Weather generally assumes any atom that cares about it will ask it directly and
 *   mobs do this in /mob/living/proc/handle_environment().
 *
 * - For this system to be scalable, it should minimize the amount of list-based
 *   processing it does and be primarily passive, allowing mobs to ignore it or
 *   poll it on their own time.
 *
 * - The weather object is queued on SSweather and is polled every fifteen seconds at time
 *   of writing. This is handled in /obj/abstract/weather_system/proc/tick().
 *
 * - When evaluating, weather will generally get more intense or more severe rather than
 *   jumping around randomly. Each state will set a minimum duration based on min/max time.
 *
 * - If polled between weather updates there is a chance of modifying wind speed and direction
 *   instead.
