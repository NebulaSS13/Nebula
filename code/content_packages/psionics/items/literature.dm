				<h1>Psychonetics</h1>

				<p>This seems to be a dry, longwinded reference text for the form of strange mental powers called psionics. The author spends way too much time trying to advertise his cult, though.</p>

				<p>The general gist of things seems to be that sometime in the last decade or so, the first cases of 'spontaneous operancy' became known. People who spent a lot of time in deep space, or who studied certain esoteric fields of mathematics, became able to perform strange feats like levitating coins or removing headaches with nothing but their minds. The text goes on to explain that psionics are perfectly harmless, and that studies (no citations) have shown operants are no more likely to go mad and murder people than anyone else.</p>

				<p>A postscript by a group called the Cuchulain Foundation invites anyone who knows an operant, or thinks they might be one, to send them a message via comms and get enrolled in their training and registration program in orbit around Neptune. It's catered. The postscript adds hastily that you should never try to activate your own latencies with trauma or drugs, as the results are often lethal.</p>
