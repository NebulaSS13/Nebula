### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.


## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_DELAY 2
WALK_DELAY 4
CREEP_DELAY 6

## Set this to 0 for perfectly smooth movement gliding, or 1 or more for delayed chess move style movements.
#GLIDE_SIZE_DELAY 0

MINIMUM_SPRINT_COST 0.8
SKILL_SPRINT_COST_RANGE 0.8
MINIMUM_STAMINA_RECOVERY 5
MAXIMUM_STAMINA_RECOVERY 5

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0
